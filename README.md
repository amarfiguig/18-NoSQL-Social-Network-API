This project aims to demonstrate the common technologies used in social networking platforms, and will utilize:

### utilize 

 * Express.js for routing;
 * MongoDB to create a database
 * Mongoose ODM
 
The API must be capable of processing significant amounts of unstructured data, and developers can test all data creation and manipulation tasks using API platforms like Postman or Insomnia.
